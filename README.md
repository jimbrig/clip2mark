# clip2mark Website

*Easily convert richly formatted text or HTML to [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)*.

## Purpose

This demo site demonstrates the use of javascript to intake contents from the clipboard (text, rich text, or HTML) and 
return as markdown.

## Demo

<https://jimbrig.github.io/clip2mark-site/>

## Usage

Simply launch the site (or open [index.html](index.html) locally) and paste some content into the browser.

You can paste multiple times, however this will overwrite the previous conversion.

## Tested browsers

-   Chrome 33 (Linux and OS X)
-   Firefox 27 (Linux)
-   Safari 5 (OS X)
-   Internet Explorer 11 (Windows)

Credits: The conversion is carried out by [to-markdown](https://github.com/domchristie/to-markdown), a Markdown converter running in the browser.
